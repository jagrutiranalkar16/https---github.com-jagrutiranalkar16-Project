            <h3>What are the points of sustainability</h3>
            <p> The term sustainability is broadly used to indicate programs, initiatives and actions aimed at the preservation of a particular resource. However, it actually refers to four distinct areas: human, social, economic and environmental known as the four pillars of sustainability.</p>
            <p>'Sustainability' also refers to the quality of a state or process that allows it to be maintained indefinitely. At present, the way we are living is not sustainable. If we carry on as we are, the Earth's natural resources and physical systems will be irreversibly damaged and depleted.</p>

            <h3>together we can save the planet</h3>
            <p>Save Earth is a call to action, urging people to protect and conserve the planet's natural resources, ecosystems, and environment. It emphasizes the importance of sustainable practices and the collective responsibility we hold in ensuring a healthier and safer planet for everyone.</p>
            <p>We need to make wasting our resources unacceptable in all aspects of our life. Every product we buy has an environmental footprint and could end up in landfill. The impact of plastic pollution on our oceans is becoming increasingly clear, having drastic impacts on marine life.</p>
